# About

This modlist is intended to be a comprehensive graphical overhaul of the game while staying true to the source material.

The primary goals of this modlist are:

- Fix glaring issues with the vanilla game
- Add new vanilla friendly content
- Upgrade the graphics without contradicting the art style
- Quality of life improvements

## My Setup
For reference this is what I am currently using to play Morrowind:

I play with my FPS capped at 60 and it doesn't drop below that except occasionally on cell transitions.

## Before We Start

This modlist was originally set up for OpenMW primarily but it has since been adapted to work equally well with both engines. Separators and mods have been marked as exclusive to either OpenMW or the original engine with MWSE where applicable and installation instructions have been separated where necessary. I am putting this list together to hopefully make the process of modding this wonderful game easier, but for my sanity's sake *please* don't ask questions that are answered in the mod's readme, description, or god forbid even the title. 
<!--
There are two lists to choose from, one is the mods I play with that has over 300 mods and 200 plugins, and the other is a small list for those that want only the essentials. Both lists will be linked in the Preamble below.
-->
**Important Note: Do not update mods mid-playthrough unless you are absolutely sure it will not cause issues, and even then ensure that you can easily revert to an older save.**

<!--
 **Disclaimer: This is not a tutorial for installing **OpenMW** or for **MO2**; I will gladly help as best I can on Discord (Pharis#2588) but there are great resources with that information readily available (some of which will be linked in a separate document) so it would seem redundant (and tiresome) to repeat here.**
