# About

Inspired by guides such as Morrowind Sharp, An Alternative to Morrowind Rebirth, and Necrolesian's mod list this is intended to be a comprehensive graphical overhaul of the game while staying true to the source material. This is not a mod list for modding Morrowind into a different game but instead it is to 



[**OpenMW**](https://openmw.org/downloads/)

## My Setup
For reference this is what I am currently using to play Morrowind: 

System | My Specs
------------- | -------------
OS | Windows 11 Pro 64-bit
CPU | Intel Core i5 12600k
RAM | 16GB DDR4
GPU | EVGA 2080 Super Black
SSD | Crucial P5 Plus NVME SSD 500GB
Monitor | Dell s2721dgf

# Before We Start

This mod list was originally set up for OpenMW primarily but it will soon be adapted to work equally well with both engines. I am putting this list together to hopefully make the process of modding this wonderful game easier, but for my sanity's sake please don't ask questions that are answered in the mod's readme, description, or god forbid even the title. 

 **Disclaimer: This is not a tutorial for installing **OpenMW** or for **MO2**; I will gladly help as best I can on Discord(Pharis#2588) but there are great resources with that information readily available(some of which will be linked in a separate document) so it would seem redundant(and tiresome) to repeat here.**

## TODO

- Adapt list to work with original engine(add MWSE section, compatibilty notes, etc.)
- Add screenshots
