# Before We Start

This list is for OpenMW but with few exceptions it will work fine on the original engine. For the original engine there are also many very impressive MWSE mods that obviously will not be featured on this list. Lastly, this is not a tutorial for installing OpenMW or for MO2; I will gladly help as best I can on Discord(Pharis#2588) but there are great resources with that information readily available so it would seem redundant to repeat here.

## My System
For reference this is what I am currently using to play OpenMW: 
System | My Specs
------------ | -------------
OS | Windows 11 Pro 64-bit
CPU | Intel Core i5 12600k
RAM | 16GB DDR4
GPU | EVGA 2080 Super Black
SSD | Crucial P5 Plus NVME SSD 500GB
Monitor | Dell s2721dgf

With this mod list my FPS is always above 60(even in Old Eboheart) with 25 cell view distance.

# Utilities

## Mod Organizer 2([MO2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files), [OpenMW Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45642?tab=files))

For modding OpenMW I use Mod Organizer 2 with the ModOrganizer-to-OpenMW plugin graciously provided by AnyOldName3. This is the method I recommend beecause it is the simplest and allows the user to more easily tweak their mod list as well as run third party programs crucial to a functioning load order.
