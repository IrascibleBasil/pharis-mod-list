nexusDescription="[center]\xfeff[b]Atlas Texture Collection\n<br />[/b][/center][b]Summary[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is a collection of atlas textures, generated from various texture replacers.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />I did not create any of the artwork in this mod. You could generate these same atlas textures yourself, using the generator batch files included with the atlas meshes, but this requires installing [url=https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php]Image Magick[/url], and in some cases resizing textures so they have the same aspect ratio as the vanilla textures. This collection simply saves you the trouble of doing all that.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Details[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Below is a list of the atlas textures in this collection, and a few notes about each.\n<br />\n<br />[u]BC Mushrooms[/u]\n<br />\n<br />These atlas textures were generated using the mushroom textures in [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-5679]Connary's Textures[/url]. To use these, first install the atlas meshes from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399]Project Atlas[/url]. I also recommend installing the atlas meshes that come with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599]Graphic Herbalism MWSE[/url] version, though this is optional. Then install the atlas textures in this mod.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Included are both the vanilla and smoothed versions of the atlas textures (they use different filenames, so just install the BC Mushrooms sub-package and you'll be covered whichever meshes you're using).\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Emperor Parasols[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />This texture was generated from the emperor parasol textures in Tyddy's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43530]Telvanni Arkitektora[/url] 1.1. Install the emperor parasol atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top of it.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Hlaalu[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />This texture was generated from Lougian's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42396]Hlaalu Retexture[/url] 2.5. (Some of the textures in that replacer are a different aspect ratio than the vanilla textures, so needed to be resized first.) Install the Hlaalu atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top of it. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />I also recommend installing the regular textures from Hlaalu Retexture; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />Alternatively, Tyddy's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46246]Hlaalu Arkitektora Vol 2[/url] includes an atlas texture, but Hlaalu Arkitektora is too light-colored for my tastes. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Imperial[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />These textures were generated from Tyddy's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43940]Imperial Ordo Arkitektora[/url] 1.0. (Some of the textures in that replacer are a different aspect ratio than the vanilla textures, so needed to be resized first.) This sub-package includes atlas textures for the Imperial architecture only; the atlas texture for the Imperial dragon statue is in another sub-package.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Install the Imperial atlas meshes from Project Atlas first. Then install the Imperial atlas textures in this mod on top. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />I also recommend installing the regular textures from Imperial Ordo Arkitektora; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place. \n<br />\n<br />Also included are smaller, half size atlas textures. Try them if the full size textures give you problems.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Redoran[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />This texture was generated from Tyddy's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46235]Redoran Arkitektora Vol 2[/url], using the generator batch file included in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43266]RR Better Redoran Architecture[/url]. This file will not work with the Redoran atlas meshes from Project Atlas (Redoran Arkitektora already includes an atlas texture download if you're using the Project Atlas meshes).\n<br />\xa0\n<br />To use this texture, install RR Better Redoran Architecture atlas meshes first, then install this atlas texture on top of it. I also recommend installing the regular textures from Redoran Arkitektora Vol 2; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Redware[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />There are two options for redware atlas textures. The textures used to generate the first option are mostly from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/21981]Redware Texture Replacer[/url] by AST (the one that isn't is from Connary's Textures), while the second option was generated from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45972]HD Clutter[/url] by qwertyquit. Install the redware atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install the atlas textures of your choice on top.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Urns[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />There are also two options for urn atlas textures, the first generated from the urn textures in Connary's Textures, and the second generated from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43541]Dunmeri Urns[/url] by Tyddy. Install the urn atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install your choice of atlas texture on top.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u]Wood Poles[/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Three of the textures used to generate this atlas texture are from Tyddy's Imperial Ordo Arkitektora; the other three are from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43520]Shacks Docks and Ships Arkitektora[/url], also by Tyddy. To use, install the wood poles atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top of it. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />This one is unique in that the Project Atlas wood poles download includes an optional hi-res texture that actually looks good in-game, but this texture is even more hi-res. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Imperial Dragon Statue\n<br />\n<br />[/u]The textures used to generate this atlas texture are mostly from Connary's Textures (the two that aren't are from [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-6990]Morrowind Visual Pack[/url]). One of the textures from Connary's is a different aspect ratio than the vanilla texture, so needed to be resized first. Install the Imperial dragon statue atlas mesh from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Nord\n<br />\n<br />[/u]This texture was generated from Tyddy's Imperial Ordo Arkitektora 1.0. (One of the textures in that replacer is a different aspect ratio than the vanilla texture, so needed to be resized first). Install the Nord atlas meshes from Project Atlas first. Then install this texture on top. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />I also recommend installing the regular textures from Imperial Ordo Arkitektora; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Nord Common\n<br />\n<br />[/u]The textures used to generate this atlas texture are mostly from Tyddy's Imperial Ordo Arkitektora (the one that isn't is from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886]Glow in the Dahrk[/url]). Some of the textures from Imperial Ordo Arkitektora are a different aspect ratio than the vanilla textures, so needed to be resized first. Install the Nord Common atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />I also recommend installing the regular textures from Imperial Ordo Arkitektora; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place.\n<br />\n<br />A smaller, half size atlas texture is included, for those experiencing problems with the full size texture.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Velothi[/u]\n<br />\n<br />This texture was generated from Lougian's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45446]Velothi Retexture[/url]. Thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/57788911]qwertyquit[/url] for generating this texture! Install the Velothi atlas meshes from Project Atlas, then install this atlas texture on top. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />I also recommend installing the regular textures from Velothi Retexture; otherwise, non-atlased surfaces will look out of place. Alternatively, you can use Tyddy's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46266]Vivec Velothi Arkitektora Vol 2[/url], which comes with its own atlas texture.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Use a mod management tool like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439]Wyre Mash[/url], or manually copy the textures directory for each sub-package you want to use to your Data Files directory.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Each of these atlas textures requires atlas meshes to work. The Redoran atlas texture included in this mod requires the atlas meshes from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43266]RR Better Redoran Architecture[/url]. The other atlas textures require the atlas meshes from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399]Project Atlas[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommendations[/b]\n<br />\n<br />For the BC Mushrooms atlas texture, the atlas meshes from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599]Graphic Herbalism MWSE version[/url] are recommended, but optional.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />It's also recommended to install the base mods for the Hlaalu, Imperial and Redoran atlas textures (Hlaalu Retexture, Imperial Ordo Arkitektora and Redoran Arkitektora Vol 2), but not required. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Version History[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Version 1.3.1 - 2020-10-13\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added mipmaps to half size Imperial and Nord Common textures, to eliminate \"shimmery\" effect.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.3 - 2020-05-04 \n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added Velothi atlas texture.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.2.1 - 2020-04-25 \n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Updated \"Redware - HD Clutter\" to version 2.6 of HD Clutter.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.2 - 2020-03-15 \n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added new Redware (HD Clutter) and Urns (Dunmeri Urns) atlas textures. \n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added half size textures for Imperial and Nord Common.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.1 - 2020-02-05\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added Imperial Dragon Statue, Nord, and Nord Common atlas textures.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.0 - 2019-08-21 \n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Initial release. \n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Credits[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />The textures used to generate the atlas textures in this archive come from the following mods: \n<br />\xa0\n<br />[url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-5679]Connary's Textures\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43541]Dunmeri Urns[/url] by Tyddy\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886]Glow in the Dahrk[/url] by Melchior Dahrk\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45972]HD Clutter[/url] by qwertyquit\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42396]Hlaalu Retexture[/url] by Lougian\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43940]Imperial Ordo Arkitektora[/url] by Tyddy\n<br />[url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-6990]Morrowind Visual Pack[/url] by Qarl and others\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46235]Redoran Arkitektora Vol 2[/url] by Tyddy\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/21981]Redware Texture Replacer[/url] by AST\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43520]Shacks Docks and Ships Arkitektora[/url] by Tyddy\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43530]Telvanni Arkitektora[/url] by Tyddy\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45446]Velothi Retexture[/url] by Lougian\n<br />\n<br />[b]Contact[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to contact me on the Nexus with any comments or suggestions. You can also find me on Discord as Necrolesian#9692.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Usage[/b]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Be sure to credit the original artists if you use any of these textures. There's no need to credit me, as I did not create any of the artwork."
